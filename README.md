## What is it about ?
It's the second exercise where i could used MySQL. 
I did some queries based on a database who grouped different ingredients and recipes.
Then i had to do a php application related to this exercise. 
I coded three different forms : one to add a new recipe, another to add a new ingredient and the last one is used to add an ingredient to a recipe and a picture to it.
We can see the list of all the recipes and when we click on one of them, all the ingredients and instructions to do it appears on the screen. There is also a picture for each of the recipes.
